# EscapeRoom
A text based Escape Room adventure game written in C++

This is an escape room style game with a twist.  You must solve the puzzle to find 
the skeleton key that unlocks the door to safety, but you must do so before the 
batteries in your flashlight are dead. Each time you move between rooms the charge 
diminishes, and once the batteries are dead, your character is plunged into darkness.
Without a source of light, they will never be able to solve the puzzle to find their 
way out of the darkness.
